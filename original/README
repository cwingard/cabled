README

This folder contains scripts that launch logged socket connections to instruments, some with 
automated command and control.  If no automation is required/desired use the BasicLogger.py.

The syntax for using any of these scripts is:

./SCRIPT.py IPADDRESS PORT basename

The convention for basename on the subsea network is
/data/INSTRUMENT_IP.IP.IP.IP_PORT
where /data/.. writes to the campus network data folder

Example
./ADCP.py 10.180.80.178 2101 /data/ADCP_10.180.80.178_2101

./BasicLogger.py 10.180.80.175 2104 /data/CTD_10.180.80.175_2104




A script can be written to startup the appropriate logger/driver script with the correctly configured argument list.  (Donâ€™t forget to chmod +x this file.) See test.run for an example.
